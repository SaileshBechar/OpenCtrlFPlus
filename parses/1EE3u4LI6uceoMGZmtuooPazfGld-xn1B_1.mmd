\begin{abstract}
We present a study of a star formation prescription in which star formation efficiency (SFE) depends on local gas density and turbulent velocity dispersion, as suggested by direct simulations of SF in turbulent giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We test the model using a simulation of an isolated Milky-Way-sized galaxy with a self-consistent treatment of turbulence on unresolved scales. We show that this prescription predicts a wide variation of local SFE per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 0.1 \%-10 \%$, and gas depletion time, $t_{\mathrm{dep}} \sim 0.1-10$ Gyr. In addition, it predicts an effective density threshold for star formation due to suppression of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in warm diffuse gas stabilized by thermal pressure. We show that the model predicts star formation rates (SFRs) in agreement with observations from the scales of individual star-forming regions to the kiloparsec scales. This agreement is nontrivial, as the model was not tuned in any way and the predicted SFRs on all scales are determined by the distribution of the GMC-scale densities and turbulent velocities $\sigma$ in the cold gas within the galaxy, which is shaped by galactic dynamics. The broad agreement of the star formation prescription calibrated in the GMC-scale simulations with observations both gives credence to such simulations and promises to put star formation modeling in galaxy formation simulations on a much firmer theoretical footing.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Numerical simulations of galaxy formation require modeling of how gas is converted into stars, a process that is not yet completely understood. Star formation is thus implemented in simulations using empirically motivated, phenomenological prescriptions. For example, in almost all such simulations star particles are formed from gas that satisfies a set of fairly ad hoc criteria, such as requiring that the gas density exceeds a certain threshold, $\rho>\rho_{\mathrm{sf}}$, or that the gas is locally compressed. Star formation rate (SFR) in this gas is usually parameterized as

$$\dot{\rho}_{\star}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}} \frac{\rho}{t_{\mathrm{sf}}}$$

where $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is an efficiency at which gas is converted into stars over the timescale $t_{\mathrm{sf}}$.

This basic approach has not changed since the early 1990 s, when it was introduced (Cen \& Ostriker 1992; Katz 1992), with the exception of SFR modulation with local molecular hydrogen fraction (Robertson \& Kravtsov 2008; Gnedin et al. 2009) and an attempt to account for turbulent gas motions in the identification of star-forming regions by Hopkins et al. (2013). The choices for the star formation eligibility criteria and values of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}}$ and $t_{\mathrm{sf}}$ do vary significantly from study to study. The most common recent choice is to adopt $t_{\mathrm{sf}}=t_{\mathrm{ff}}$, where the free-fall time is defined as $t_{\mathrm{ff}}=\sqrt{3 \pi / 32 G \rho}$. In this case, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{sf}}$ has a meaning of star formation efficiency (SFE) per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$.

In some studies specific values of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ are chosen to reproduce the observed relation between gas surface density and SFR (Schmidt 1959, 1963; Kennicutt 1998; Bigiel et al. 2008; Kennicutt \& Evans 2012). In other studies, the assumed $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ value is based on the independent reasoning of what it should be in real star-forming regions. Such simulations require selfregulation by a complex interplay between star formation and feedback to produce the observed SFE on scales of the entire galaxy (e.g., Stinson et al. 2006; Ceverino \& Klypin 2009; Hopkins et al. 2011). In general, recent results indicate that when effects of feedback are weak, the star formation on the galactic scale is highly sensitive to the assumed input value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$, whereas when feedback is strong, the sensitivity is significantly weaker (e.g., Agertz et al. 2013).

Regardless of the $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ value choice, almost all galaxy formation simulations assume that this value is universal in space and time. Consequences of such an assumption on galaxy evolution remain unexplored.

There is a growing number of observational indications that $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) varies widely from $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 0.1 \%$ to $\sim 30 \%$ (Heiderman et al. 2010; Lada et al. 2010; Murray 2011; Evans et al. 2014). There is also evidence that in the Milky Way the overall molecular gas forms stars at a considerably lower efficiency than typical wellstudied dense star-forming regions. In particular, the molecular gas depletion time for the entire Galaxy is $t_{\text {dep, }, \mathrm{MW}} \equiv M_{\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{MW}} / \dot{M}_{\star, \mathrm{MW}} \sim 10^{9} M_{\odot} /\left(1.5 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\right) \sim 0.7$ Gyr. This is an order of magnitude longer timescale than typically inferred in active star-forming molecular clouds: $t_{\mathrm{dep}, \mathrm{GMC}}=$ $t_{\mathrm{ff}} / \epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 5 \mathrm{Myr} / 0.05 \sim 100 \mathrm{Myr}$.

The strong variation of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ also naturally arises in models of star formation in the turbulent medium. These models are motivated by the observed scaling relations between size, mass, and velocity dispersion of GMCs (Larson 1981) that are consistent with a supersonic turbulent cascade in interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Kritsuk et al. 2013). Over the past two decades several analytical models for star formation in turbulent GMCs have been proposed (Krumholz \& McKee 2005; Padoan \& Nordlund 2011; Federrath \& Klessen 2012; Hennebelle \& Chabrier 2013). Star formation in such models is assumed to occur in the densest, gravitationally unstable tail of the gas density distribution.
