As we discussed in Section 3.1, there is a mismatch of our resolution scale with the sizes of the observed GMCs. This may be a cause of concern for the comparison presented above. However, our convergence study indicates that the agreement with observations persists at higher resolutions. At smaller $\Delta$, denser and denser structures are being resolved, while turbulent velocities in these structures keep following the average trend given by Equation (7), $\sigma \propto n^{1 / 2}$, resulting in similar $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ distributions. As a consequence, in higher-resolution runs the PDF shown in Figure 3 shifts to higher surface densities along $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=$ const lines and remains in good agreement with both local and extragalactic data. However, at some point, when the turbulent inertial range becomes fairly resolved, we expect the $\sigma-n$ trend to reverse to the observed Larson scaling, $\sigma \propto$ $n^{-0.5}$. This will cause further motion of the PDF toward the observed data points perpendicular to the $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=$ const lines. In other words, the obtained scaling of $\sigma$ with density makes SFE a weak function of scale down to the scale of individual GMCs in the inertial regime. This weak dependence justifies the comparison of SFRs on the scale of individual cells in our simulation to the observed SFRs on GMC scales.

\subsection{Comparison with Observed Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) Relations}

The distribution of the local SFR in galaxies averaged over certain spatial and temporal scales results in the observed power-law relation between SFR and gas surface density, the KS relation (Schmidt 1959, 1963; Kennicutt 1998). When averaged over entire galaxies, the KS relation indicates the global gas depletion time of molecular gas of $t_{\text {dep }} \equiv \rho / \dot{\rho}_{\star} \sim$ 2-3 Gyr (e.g., Bigiel et al. 2008). In the Milky Way this timescale is somewhat shorter: $t_{\text {dep,Mw }} \sim 10^{9} M_{\odot} / 1.5 M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ $\sim 0.7 \mathrm{Gyr}$.

In our simulation without any tuning we obtain the global depletion time of $\sim 1 \mathrm{Gyr}$, which is similar to that of the Milky Way. However, given that in our simulation local consumption time exhibits wide variation (Figure 1(f)), this global depletion time is a result of averaging regions, which form stars relatively fast (with $t_{\text {dep }} \sim 100 \mathrm{Myr}$ ), with gas, which forms stars slowly (with $t_{\text {dep }}>3 \mathrm{Gyr}$ ). Observationally, such spatial variation of $t_{\text {dep }}$ can be studied in high-resolution extragalactic SFR surveys (e.g., Lewis et al. 2015; Rebolledo et al. 2015).

Figure 4 compares the KS relation for our simulated galaxy with the relations observed for seven nearby spirals in patches of $750 \mathrm{pc}$ (Bigiel et al. 2008) and measured in the Milky Way in radial annuli (Misiriotis et al. 2006). In our simulation we integrate the SFR and gas density perpendicular to the disk plane and then average them in patches of $1 \times 1 \mathrm{kpc}$. The star formation is temporally averaged over $30 \mathrm{Myr}$ to match the averaging scales corresponding to star formation indicators typically used to estimate SFR in observations (e.g., see Table 1 in Kennicutt \& Evans 2012). The figure shows that our simulation predicts the KS relation in broad agreement with observations. We stress that this agreement is achieved without any ad hoc assumptions about SFE or threshold: our results are based on direct application of the SFE prescription, calibrated on simulations of turbulent GMCs, in a modeling of global disk evolution.

At $\Sigma_{\mathrm{g}} \sim 10 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$ our simulation predicts a relation that is somewhat steeper than observed. This may be due to the specifics of the disk structure and the dynamics of the galaxy we model. For example, the KS relation in individual galaxies

Figure 4. Our predicted averaged SFRs agree with observed KS relations. Blue color and black contours (68\% and 95\% c.l.) indicate smoothed distribution of vertically integrated SFR and gas density in $1 \times 1 \mathrm{kpc}$ patches. To calculate SFR in each patch, we divide its total stellar mass formed over the last $t_{\mathrm{SFR}}=30 \mathrm{Myr}$ of the disk evolution by the timescale $t_{\mathrm{SFR}}$. For comparison we also plot a single gray contour (68\% c.l.) obtained for $t_{\mathrm{SFR}}=100 \mathrm{Myr}$. We compare our results to the observed SFRs on the $750 \mathrm{pc}$ scale in seven nearby spirals (Bigiel et al. 2008) and measurements of the SFR on a comparable scale in the Milky Way (Misiriotis et al. 2006). In the observational data we correct the gas surface densities for helium assuming $25 \%$ mass fraction. Gray dotted lines correspond to constant values of $t_{\text {dep }}$.

studied by Bigiel et al. (2008) exhibits significant variation in normalization and slope. For instance, NGC 628 and NGC 3184 also have a steep relation between SFR and gas surface densities, similar to the distribution in our simulation. Variation of the KS relation with the disk properties thus requires further investigation.

Another factor affecting the predicted KS relation at low surface densities is the averaging timescale of the SFR. For example, adopting the averaging timescale of $100 \mathrm{Myr}$ instead of $30 \mathrm{Myr}$ results in a noticeably flatter KS relation at low $\Sigma_{g}$. Note also that the absence of star-forming regions with $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}<10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1} \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ in Figure 4 is an artifact of numerical resolution and is set by the minimal mass of stellar particles we form in our simulation $\left(10^{4} M_{\odot}\right)$.

Finally, at the highest surface densities, the KS relation predicted in our simulation is shaped by the star formation in high-density clumps. Although such regions are absent in the Milky Way itself, they are often observed in other galaxies. For instance, the clump-driven star formation regime may have implications for starburst galaxies, which have surface densities and SFRs comparable to or even higher than the highest values in our simulations (e.g., Kennicutt 1998; Kennicutt \& Evans 2012). This is because starburst galaxies tend to have higher gas fractions and gas surface densities and are therefore more unstable. As a result, they develop more self-gravitating clumps that have higher $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ and shift the global SFR toward higher values for a given surface density.

Our convergence tests indicate that with our implementation of feedback the distribution of SFRs averaged on $1 \mathrm{kpc}$ scales
