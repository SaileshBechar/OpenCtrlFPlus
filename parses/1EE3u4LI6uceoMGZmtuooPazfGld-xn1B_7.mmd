Given the importance of turbulence for our adopted star formation prescription, we begin with the discussion of the small-scale subgrid turbulence in the disk. Figure 1(c) shows that the subgrid model predicts the rms turbulent velocities, $\sigma$, at the level of a few to $10 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ on the scale of our smallest grid cells $(40 \mathrm{pc})$. This result agrees with the observed velocity dispersion in GMCs (Gammie et al. 1991; Bolatto et al. 2008), Milky Way dynamics (Kalberla \& Dedes 2008), and extragalactic H I data (Petric \& Rupen 2007; Tamburro et al. 2009), as well as with high-resolution disk simulations (Agertz et al. 2009a). The turbulent velocities in our simulation increase toward the disk center, where gravitational instabilities and frequent SNe maintain higher $\sigma$ (Agertz et al. 2009a). High $\sigma$ in bright spots that correspond to hot gas $\left(10^{5}-10^{6} \mathrm{~K}\right.$ in Figure 1(b)) are driven by expanding SN bubbles. Dense cold spiral arms are typically more turbulent than the surrounding gas, and therefore they are well traceable in the $\sigma$ map, especially at $r>5 \mathrm{kpc}$. Enhanced turbulent velocities in the spiral arms result from the compression of interarm turbulence. Similarly, collapse of gas into dense gaseous clumps also results in high turbulent velocities (circled in Figures 1(a) and (c)).

Quantitative conclusions about turbulence in different ISM phases can be drawn from the distribution of $\sigma$ as a function of local gas density shown in Figure 2(a). In this plot several distinct phases are highlighted using color: the warm diffuse gas at $T \sim 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}$ (yellow), the cold dense gas in spiral arms and dense clumps (blue), and the hot tenuous gas at $T>10^{5} \mathrm{~K}$ in the SN bubbles and hot gaseous halo surrounding the disk (red). The contours enclosing different mass fractions show that most of the gas mass is in the warm and cold phases.

The warm gas phase corresponds to the diffuse gas between spiral arms and around the disk plane (white color in Figure 1(b)). In this phase the turbulence is in an approximate equilibrium between production due to instabilities (e.g., Bournaud et al. 2010), sourcing by $\mathrm{SNe}$, and viscous dissipation into heat. Most of the gas mass in this phase resides on the disk outskirts ( $r>5 \mathrm{kpc}$, labeled as the "outer disk"), and the typical subgrid turbulent velocities are $\sim 1-2 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, with a significant scatter of $\sim 0.5$ dex. Note that the actual velocity dispersion of the disk would include resolved gas motions that are considerably larger. As mentioned above, $\sigma$ in the diffuse gas increases toward the disk center and may reach a few tens to $100 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Some of the warm gas with the largest velocity dispersions resides in expanding SN bubbles, which drive turbulent velocities to the highest values found in our simulations, a few hundred kilometers per second.

The cold gas phase is, of course, the most interesting for star formation. The figure shows that such gas has typical subgrid turbulent velocities of $\sigma \sim 3-10 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This result agrees with the observed three-dimensional turbulent velocities in GMCs ( $\sim 8 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ on scales of $40 \mathrm{pc}$ in Bolatto et al. 2008). We find that the actual value of $\sigma$ correlates with the local compression rate $\left(-\nabla_{i} u_{i}\right)$. This result indicates that the main source of turbulent energy in this regime is heating by compression of the diffuse gas (Robertson \& Goldreich 2012). Specifically, as a parcel of relaxed gas at $T \sim 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}$ enters a spiral arm, both thermal and turbulent energies increase, as pressures associated with thermal and random motions do negative work during

Figure 2. Distribution of SGS turbulent velocities $\sigma$ (top panel) and the resulting star formation efficiencies per free-fall time $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ (bottom panel) at different densities. The distributions take into account all cells within a cylindrical volume with $R<20 \mathrm{kpc}$ ( 6 initial scale radii) and $|z|<1 \mathrm{kpc}$ (total height is $\sim 6$ initial scale heights) centered at the disk center. To increase statistics, we average PDFs over 23 snapshots at $600 \pm 10$ Myr. Colors show the mass-weighted average temperature in the bin, and its intensity indicates the total mass in the bin. Black contours enclose 25\%, 68\%, 95\% (top) and 5\%, $15 \%, 30 \%$ (bottom) of the current total gas mass. The turbulent velocities in cold spiral arms result from compression of diffuse gas and scale with density roughly as $\sigma \propto n^{1 / 2}$ (dashed red line given by Equation (7)). The linear structures at the upper right end of the $n-\sigma$ distribution correspond to dense gaseous clouds with $\sigma \approx$ const. Panel (b) shows the distribution of star formation efficiency obtained from the local gas density, temperature, and SGS turbulent velocities. The adopted model naturally introduces an exponential cutoff at densities $n \sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. If compared to universal $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ prescriptions, the turbulent model predicts broad variation by orders of magnitude, even though the average SFE is still $\sim 1 \%$.

compression. However, at typical spiral arm densities the excess of thermal energy is quickly radiated away and the gas cools down. In contrast to thermal energy, turbulent energy dissipates on the local crossing timescale, $t \sim \Delta / \sigma$ (e.g., Mac Low et al. 1998), which may be longer than the time spent by the gas parcel inside the spiral arm. The turbulent dissipation timescale and the time spent in the spiral arm can be estimated
