\begin{abstract}
We present results of large-scale three-dimensional simulations of supersonic Euler turbulence with the piecewise parabolic method and multiple grid resolutions up to $2048^{3}$ points. Our numerical experiments describe nonmagnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of state and an rms Mach number of 6 . We discuss numerical resolution issues and demonstrate convergence, in a statistical sense, of the inertial range dynamics in simulations on grids larger than $512^{3}$ points. The simulations allowed us to measure the absolute velocity scaling exponents for the first time. The inertial range velocity scaling in this strongly compressible regime deviates substantially from the incompressible Kolmogorov laws. The slope of the velocity power spectrum, for instance, is -1.95 compared to $-5 / 3$ in the incompressible case. The exponent of the third-order velocity structure function is 1.28, while in incompressible turbulence it is known to be unity. We propose a natural extension of Kolmogorov's phenomenology that takes into account compressibility by mixing the velocity and density statistics and preserves the Kolmogorov scaling of the power spectrum and structure functions of the density-weighted velocity $\boldsymbol{v} \equiv \rho^{1 / 3} \boldsymbol{u}$. The low-order statistics of $\boldsymbol{v}$ appear to be invariant with respect to changes in the Mach number. For instance, at Mach 6 the slope of the power spectrum of $v$ is -1.69 , and the exponent of the third-order structure function of $v$ is unity. We also directly measure the mass dimension of the "fractal" density distribution in the inertial subrange, $D_{m} \approx 2.4$, which is similar to the observed fractal dimension of molecular clouds and agrees well with the cascade phenomenology.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Understanding the nature of supersonic turbulence is of fundamental importance in both astrophysics and aeronautical engineering. In the interstellar medium (ISM), highly compressible turbulence is believed to control star formation in dense molecular clouds (Padoan \& Nordlund 2002). In radiation-driven outflows from carbon-dominant Wolf-Rayet stars, supersonic turbulence creates highly clumpy structure that is stochastically variable on a very short timescale (e.g., Acker et al. 2002). Finally, a whole class of more terrestrial applications deals with the drag and stability of projectiles traveling through the air at hypersonic speeds.

Molecular clouds have an extremely inhomogeneous structure, and the intensity of their internal motions corresponds to an rms Mach number of order 20. Larson (1981) has demonstrated that within the range of scales from 0.1 to $100 \mathrm{pc}$, the gas density and the velocity dispersion tightly correlate with the cloud size. ${ }^{2}$ Supported by other independent observational facts indicating scale invariance, these relationships are often interpreted in terms of supersonic turbulence with characteristic Reynolds numbers $\operatorname{Re} \sim 10^{8}$ (Elmegreen \& Scalo 2004). Within a wide range of densities above $10^{3} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, the gas temperature remains close to $\approx 10 \mathrm{~K}$, since the thermal equilibration time at these densities is shorter than a typical hydrodynamic (HD) timescale. Thus, an

Self-gravity, magnetic fields, chemistry, cooling, and heating, as well as radiative transfer, should ultimately be accounted for in turbulent models of molecular clouds. However, since highly compressible turbulence still remains an unsolved problem even in the absence of magnetic fields, our main focus here is specifically on the more tractable HD aspects of the problem.

Magnetic fields are important for the general ISM dynamics and, particularly, for the star formation process. Observations of molecular clouds are consistent with the presence of superAlfvenic turbulence (Padoan et al. 2004a), and thus, the average magnetic field strength may be much smaller than required to support the clouds against the gravitational collapse (Padoan \& Nordlund 1997, 1999). Even weak fields, however, have the potential to modify the properties of supersonic turbulent flows through the effects of magnetic tension and magnetic pressure and introduce small-scale anisotropies. Magnetic tension tends to stabilize hydrodynamically unstable postshock shear layers (Miura \& Pritchett 1982; Keppens et al. 1999; Ryu et al. 2000; Baty et al. 2003). The shock jump conditions modified by magnetic pressure result in substantially different predictions for the initial mass function of stars forming in nonmagnetic and magnetized cases via turbulent fragmentation (Padoan et al. 2007). Remarkably, although not surprisingly (e.g., Armi \& Flament 1985), the impact of magnetic field on the low-order statistics of super-Alfvenic turbulence appears to be rather limited. At a grid resolution of $1024^{3}$ points, the slopes of the power spectra in our simulations show stronger sensitivity to the numerical diffusivity of the scheme of choice than to the presence of the magnetic field (Padoan et al. 2007). The similarity of nonmagnetized and weakly
