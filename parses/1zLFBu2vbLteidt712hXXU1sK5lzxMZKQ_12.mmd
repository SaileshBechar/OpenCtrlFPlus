\subsection{Fractal Dimension of the Mass Distribution}

It is known from observations and experiments that the distribution of dissipation in turbulent flows is intrinsically intermittent and this intermittency bears a hierarchical nature. This fact is in apparent contradiction with the $\mathrm{K} 41$ theory that assumes that the rate of dissipation is uniform in space and constant in time. Mandelbrot (1974) introduced a new concept of the "intrinsic fractional dimension of the carrier," $D$, that characterizes the geometric properties of a subset of the whole volume of turbulent flow where the bulk of intermittent dissipation occurs. He also studied the relation between $D$ and scaling properties of turbulence. In particular, he suggested that isosurfaces of scalars (such as concentration or temperature) in turbulent flows with Burgers and Kolmogorov statistics are best described by fractal dimensions of $3-1 / 2$ and $3-1 / 3$, respectively (Mandelbrot 1975). In the following we focus on similar questions with respect to supersonic turbulence.

In turbulence research there are several approaches to assess the flow geometry quantitatively. Indirectly, the information on fractional dimension of dissipative structures in turbulent flows can be obtained as a by-product of application of phenomenological cascade models, e.g., the hierarchical structure (HS) model developed by She \& Leveque (1994) and Dubrulle (1994) for incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence and later extended to supersonic flows by Boldyrev (2002). The HS model is based on the assumption of log-Poisson statistics for the energy dissipation rate and provides an estimate for fractal dimension, $D$, of the most singular structures based on the detailed knowledge of high-order velocity structure functions (e.g., Kritsuk \& Norman 2004; Padoan et al. 2004b). While the HS model appears to reproduce experimental data quite well in a rather diverse set of applications extending far beyond the limits of the original study of fully developed turbulence (e.g., Liu et al. 2004), the uncertainty in the scaling properties of high-order velocity statistics remains large. To nail down the $D$ value thus obtained from numerical experiments, one has to go beyond the current resolution limits to resolve the inertial subrange dynamics sufficiently well and to provide a statistical data sample of a reasonably large size. That would reduce the effects of the statistical noise and anisotropies which tend to strongly contaminate the high-order velocity statistics (e.g., Porter et al. 2002). We leave a more detailed discussion of the HS model to a follow-up paper and focus here instead on a direct measurement of the fractal dimension of the density field using conventional techniques. Note, however, that there is no trivial physical connection between the fractal dimensions measured by these two techniques, i.e., they do not necessarily refer to the same fractal object, since one is based exclusively on the velocity information, while the other is based on the density information.

For physical systems in three-dimensional space, like supersonic turbulent boxes, it is often easier to directly estimate the "mass dimension" that contains information about the density scaling with size. To do so, we select a sequence of box sizes $l_{1}>l_{2}>\ldots>l_{n}$ and cover high-density peaks with concentric cubes of those linear sizes. Denoting $M\left(l_{i}\right)$ as the mass contained inside the box of size $l_{i}$, one can plot $\log M\left(l_{i}\right)$ versus $\log l_{i}$ to reveal a scaling range where the points follow a straight line,

$$M(l) \propto l^{D_{m}} .$$

FIG. 18.-Gas mass within a box of size $l$ normalized by $l^{2}$ as a function of the box size. The mass dimension $D_{m}$ of the density distribution is determined by the slope of this relationship. A horizontal line would correspond to $D_{m}=2$. The data points represent averages over five density snapshots. The straight lines are the least-squares fits to the data for $\log l / \Delta \in[0.5,1.2]$ and $\log l / \Delta \in[1.7,2]$. $[$ See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]

The slope of the line, $D_{m}$, then gives an estimate of the mass dimension for the density distribution. Note that the centers of the box hierarchies cannot be chosen arbitrarily. They must belong to the fractal set, or else, in the limit $l \rightarrow 0$, one would end up with boxes containing essentially no mass. In practice, we selected as centers the positions where the gas density is higher or equal to one-half of the density maximum for a given snapshot. We then determined $D_{m}$ by taking an average over all centers from five statistically independent density snapshots separated from each other by roughly one dynamical time.

Figure 18 shows the mass scaling with the box size $l$ compensated by $l^{-2}$ based on the procedure described above. The slope of the mass scale dependence breaks from roughly 2 in the dissipation-dominated range of small scales to $\sim 2.4$ in the inertial subrange that is free from the bottleneck effect. The transition point at $l \sim 30 \Delta$ coincides with the break point present in all power spectra discussed above. On small scales, the geometry of the density field in supersonic turbulence is dominated by two-dimensional shock surfaces. This is where the numerical dissipation dominates in PPM.

On larger scales, where the dissipation is practically negligible, the clustered shocks form a sophisticated pattern with fractal dimension $D_{m}=2.39 \pm 0.01$. Since the dynamic range of our simulations is limited, we can only reproduce this scaling in a quite narrow interval from $\sim 40 \Delta$ to $\sim 160 \Delta$, and thus, the actual uncertainty of our estimate for $D_{m}$ in the inertial range can still be on the order of \pm 0.1 or even larger. The break present in the $\log M-\log l$ relation may indicate a change in intermittency properties of turbulence at the meeting point of the inertial and dissipation ranges (see, e.g., Frisch 1995).

\subsection{A Simple Compressible Cascade Model}

More than half a century ago, von WeizsAcker (1951) introduced a phenomenological model for three-dimensional compressible turbulence with an intermittent, scale-invariant hierarchy of density fluctuations described by a simple equation that relates the mass density at two successive levels to the corresponding scales through a universal measure of the degree of compression, $\alpha$,

$$\frac{\rho_{\nu}}{\rho_{\nu-1}}=\left(\frac{l_{\nu}}{l_{\nu-1}}\right)^{-3 \alpha}$$
