FIG. 7.-Velocity power spectrum compensated by $k^{2}$. Note a large-scale excess of power at $l \in[256,1024] \Delta$ due to external forcing, a short straight section in the uncontaminated inertial subrange $l \in[40,256] \Delta$, and a small-scale excess at $l<40 \Delta$ due to the bottleneck phenomenon. The straight lines represent the leastsquares fits to the data for $\log k / k_{\min } \in[0.6,1.1]$ and $\log k / k_{\min } \in[1.2,1.7]$.

FIG. 9.-Same as Fig. 7, but for the dilatational velocity component. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.] Kolmogorov slopes. Clearly, it is difficult to get reliable estimates for the inertial range power indices from simulations with resolution up to $512^{3}$, since the slope of the spectrum is so dependent on numerical diffusivity. To study higher Mach number flows with PPM, an even higher resolution would be required. Note that with other numerical methods, one typically needs to use even larger grids, since the amount of dissipation provided by PPM is quite small compared to what is usually given in finitedifference schemes. In low-resolution simulations with high numerical dissipation that depends on the wavenumber as $\sim k^{2}$ or weaker, the power spectra appear steeper than they would have been when properly resolved.

In simulations with AMR, the grid resolution is nonuniform, and scale dependence (as well as nonuniformity) of numerical diffusion becomes even more complex. One should generally expect a more extended range of wavenumbers affected by numerical dissipation in AMR simulations than in uniform grid simulations, when the effective resolution is the same. The dependence of the effective numerical diffusivity on the wavenumber in the AMR runs is, therefore, weaker than in simulations on uniform grids, and the bottleneck bump should be suppressed.

In Figure 6 we combined the velocity power spectra from the unigrid simulations at $256^{3}, 512^{3}$, and $1024^{3}$ grid points with the diffusion coefficient $K=0$ to illustrate the convergence of the inertial range scaling with the improved resolution. All three simulations were performed with the same large-scale driving force, and the spectra were averaged over the same time interval, so the only difference between them is the resolution-controlled effective Reynolds number. We plotted the compensated spectra $k^{2} \mathcal{E}(k)$ to specifically exaggerate the relatively small changes in the slopes. The overplotted power spectrum from a single snapshot from our largest to date AMR simulation with the effective resolution of $2048^{3}$ grid points seems to confirm the (self-) convergence. Thus, one may hope that our estimates of the scaling exponents based on the time-averaged statistics from the $1024^{3}$ simulation will not be too far off from those that correspond to $\operatorname{Re} \rightarrow \infty$. We further validate this statement in $\S 3.4$, where we discuss the scaling properties of the velocity structure functions. Note also the suppression of the bottleneck bump visible in the AMR spectrum that occurs due to the higher effective diffusivity as we discussed earlier.

Our reference velocity power spectrum from the $1024^{3}$ simulation is repeated in Figure 7 with the best-fit linear approximations. It follows a power law with an index $\beta=1.95 \pm 0.02$ within the range of scales $l \in[40,256] \Delta$ and has a shallower slope, $\beta_{b}=1.72$, for the bottleneck bump. After Helmholtz decomposition, $\mathcal{E}(k)=\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)+\mathcal{E}_{D}(k)$, the spectra for the solenoidal and dilatational components show the inertial range power indices of $\beta_{S}=1.92 \pm 0.02$ and $\beta_{D}=2.02 \pm 0.02$, respectively (see Figs. 8 and 9 ). The difference in the slopes of $\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$ and $\mathcal{E}_{D}(k)$ is about $5 \sigma$, i.e., significant. Both spectra display flattening due to the bottleneck with indices of $\beta_{b, S}=1.70$ and $\beta_{b, D}=1.74$ in the near-dissipative range. The fraction of energy in dilatational modes quickly drops from about $50 \%$ at $k=k_{\min }$ down to $30 \%$ at $k / k_{\min } \approx 50$ and then returns back to a level of $45 \%$ at the Nyquist frequency.

In summary, the inertial range scaling of the velocity power spectrum in highly compressible turbulence tends to be closer to the Burgers scaling with a power index of $\beta=2$ rather than to the Kolmogorov $\beta=5 / 3$ scaling suggested for the mildly compressible transonic simulations by Porter et al. (2002). The inertial range scaling exponents of the power spectra for the solenoidal and dilatational velocities are not the same, with the latter demonstrating a steeper Burgers scaling, containing about $30 \%$ of the
