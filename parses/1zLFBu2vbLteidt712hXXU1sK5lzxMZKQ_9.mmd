The spectrum displays flattening at high wavenumbers due to the bottleneck effect, which is similar to what we have already seen in the velocity power spectra $\mathcal{E}(k)$. The flat part scales roughly as $\sim k^{-1.3}$ and occupies the same range of wavenumbers as in the velocity spectrum. Since the kinetic energy spectrum is sensitive to the rather sporadic activity of density fluctuations, timeaveraging is essential to get a robust estimate for the power index.

We performed a decomposition of $\boldsymbol{w} \equiv \sqrt{\rho} \boldsymbol{u}$ into the solenoidal and dilatational parts $\boldsymbol{w}_{S, D}$ such that $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{w}_{S}=\nabla \times \boldsymbol{w}_{D} \equiv 0$ and computed the energy spectra for both components, $E(k)=$ $E_{S}(k)+E_{D}(k)$. The inertial range spectral exponents for the solenoidal and dilatational components are the same, $\beta=1.52 \pm$ 0.01 for both, and also coincide with the slope of $E(k)$. This remarkable property of $E(k)$ suggests that in the supersonic regime $^{7}$ we are dealing with a single compressible cascade of kinetic energy where the density fluctuations provide a tight coupling between the solenoidal and dilatational modes of $\boldsymbol{w}$. This picture is similar in spirit to that discussed by Kornreich \& Scalo (2000) in their $\S 3.7$. However, in contrast to Kornreich \& Scalo (2000) our simulations demonstrate that nonlinear HD instabilities are heavily involved in the kinetic energy transfer through the hierarchy of scales. The association of $\boldsymbol{w}$ with the kinetic energy distribution as a function of scale makes this quantity a better candidate than the pure velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ for employing in compressible cascade models, since $\boldsymbol{w}$ uniquely represents the physics of the cascade and there is no need to track the variation of $\mathcal{E}_{D}(k) / \mathcal{E}(k)$ as a function of wavenumber in the inertial subrange in addition to variations with the rms Mach number.

The total kinetic energy power is dominated by the solenoidal component $\boldsymbol{w}_{S}$ over the whole spectrum. Within the inertial range, $E_{S}(k)$ contributes about $68 \%$ of the total power, then $\sim 66 \%$ in the bottleneck-contaminated interval, and up to $\sim 74 \%$ further down at the Nyquist frequency. Compare with the solenoidal part of the velocity power, $\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$, that constitutes about $65 \%-70 \%$ within the inertial range and only $55 \%$ of the total power at the Nyquist frequency (see $\S 3.3$ ).

Figure 14 illustrates the difference in structures seen in the enstrophy field (top) and in the "denstrophy" field $[\mid \nabla \times$ $\left.(\sqrt{\rho} \boldsymbol{u})\right|^{2} / \rho$, bottom $]$ that helps to understand the small-scale excess of power in $E_{S}(k)$ with respect to $\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$. While the corrugated shock surfaces (U-shapes), which are also the regions of very strong shear, are seen as dark wormlike structures of excess enstrophy and denstrophy in both the top and the bottom panels of Figure 14, nearly planar shock fronts that carry a negligible amount of shear (this is also why they remain planar) are clearly missing in the enstrophy plot. Since the denstrophy field contains a greater number of sharper small-scale structures, it should be expected that $E_{S}(k)$ carries more small-scale power than $\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$. Overall, the structures captured as intense by the denstrophy field closely follow the regions of high energy dissipation rate (see the integrand in eq. [7] and Fig. 17, bottom left).

\subsection{Density Power Spectrum}

The power spectrum of the gas density shows a short straight section with a slope of $-1.07 \pm 0.01$ in the range of scales from

${ }^{7}$ In our Mach 6 simulations at $1024^{3}$, the sonic scale $l_{s}$ such that $u\left(l_{s}\right) \sim$ $c=1$ is located in the middle of the bottleneck bump, and thus, the velocities within the inertial range are supersonic. One could possibly detect a break in the velocity power spectrum from a steep Burgers-like supersonic scaling at low $k$ to a shallow Kolmogorov-like transonic scaling at higher wavenumbers in Mach 6 simulations with resolution of $4000^{3}$ grid points or higher. Note, that as we show later in $\S 3.9$, the power spectrum of $\rho^{1 / 3} \boldsymbol{u}$ would not show such a break and would instead approximately follow the Kolmogorov 5/3 law all over the inertial interval.

$250 \Delta$ down to $40 \Delta$ followed by flattening due to a power pileup at higher wavenumbers (see Fig. 15). Similar power-law sections and excess of power in the same wavenumber ranges were seen earlier in the velocity and the kinetic energy power spectra (Figs. 7 and 13).

At the resolution of $512^{3}$, the bottleneck bump at high wavenumbers and the external forcing at low $k$ leave essentially no room for the uncontaminated inertial range in $k$-space, even though the density spectrum at $512^{3}$ (not shown) also has a straight power-law section. At $512^{3}$, the slope of the density
