Fig. 17. - Coherent structures in Mach 6 turbulence at resolution of $1024^{3}$. Projections along the minor axis of a subvolume of $700 \times 500 \times 250$ zones for the density (top left), the enstrophy $\left(|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{u}|^{2} ;\right.$ top right), the dissipation rate (the integrand $|\boldsymbol{\Phi} \cdot \boldsymbol{u}|$ in eq. [7]; bottom left), and the dilatation $(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} ;$ bottom right). The logarithmic gray-scale ramp shows the lower values as dark in all cases except for the density. The inertial subrange structures correspond to scales between 40 and 250 zones and represent a fractal with $D_{m} \approx 2.4$. The most singular structures in the dissipation range $(l<30 \Delta)$ are shocks with fractal dimension $D_{m}=2$.

exactly $-5 / 3$, i.e., coincides with the Kolmogorov velocity spectrum power index. Since apparently $\mathcal{M}_{41} \lesssim 1$, subsonic (but not too subsonic) compressible turbulent flows should have nearKolmogorov scaling, even for the density power spectrum (cf. Armstrong et al. 1995).

\subsection{Coherent Structures in Supersonic Turbulence}

Let us now look more carefully at the morphology of those structures in supersonic turbulence that determine its scaling properties. The very first look at the projected density field shown in Figure 16 reveals a plethora of filamentary structures very similar to what one usually sees as cirrus clouds in the sky. This is roughly what one can directly observe, albeit with a somewhat poorer resolution, in the intensity maps of nearby molecular clouds and in the WC-type turbulent stellar winds from the Wolf-Rayet stars.

If one zooms in on a subvolume and takes a slab that is 5 times thinner than the whole domain, one will start seeing the elements of that cloudy structure, namely, numerous nested U- and V-shaped bow shocks or "Mach cones" (Kritsuk et al. 2006). Figure 17 shows an example of coherent structures that form in supersonic flows as a result of development and saturation of linear and nonlinear instabilities in shear layers formed by shock interactions. ${ }^{8}$ The instabilities assist in breaking the dense postshock gas layers into supersonically moving fragments. Because of their extremely high density contrast with the surrounding medium, the fragments behave as effectively solid obstacles with respect to the medium. These coherent structures are transient and form in supersonic collisions of counterpropagating flow patches or "blobs" (Kritsuk \& Norman 2004; Heitsch et al. 2005; Kritsuk et al. 2006). Then they dissipate and similar structures appear again and again at other locations. The nested $\mathrm{V}$-shapes can be best seen in slabs with a finite thickness of the order of their characteristic size (i.e., $\sim 200 \Delta$ in our $1024^{3}$ run) that belongs to the resolved inertial subrange of scales. They are less noticeable in full-box projections where multiple structures of the same sort tend to overlap along the line of sight as in Figure 16. Since the "cones" are essentially three-dimensional, they can also be hardly seen in thin slices (see Fig. 14). Patterns of the same morphology were identified in the peripheral parts of the M1-67 nebula

8 The (incomplete) list of potential candidates includes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Helmholtz 1868), the nonlinear supersonic vortex sheet instability (Miles 1957), and the nonlinear thin shell instability (Vishniac 1994).
