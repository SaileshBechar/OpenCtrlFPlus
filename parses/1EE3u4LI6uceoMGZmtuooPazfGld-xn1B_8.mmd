where $w_{\text {arm }}$ is a typical spiral arm width and $v_{\text {arm }}$ is its typical velocity relative to the ambient gas. Here we neglect the fact that gas may enter into spiral arms at different angles and then travel along the spiral arm. We approximate the spiral arm passing time simply as $w_{\text {arm }} / v_{\text {arm }}$, with typical values found in our simulation. Actual $t_{\text {arm }}$ may vary around the estimation from Equation (6) depending on the local gas dynamics.

In the outer disk, where the pre-shocked gas has low turbulent velocities $\left(\sigma \sim 1 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$, turbulence decays slowly $\left(t_{\mathrm{dec}}>t_{\mathrm{arm}}\right)$ and $\sigma$ increases in spiral arms. The bimodal distribution of mass in Figure 2(a) indicates that the compression is fast and, therefore, the gas either is relaxed or resides in a spiral arm. In the inner disk, where $\sigma$ is high $\left(\sim 10 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$, turbulence may decay during compression $\left(t_{\mathrm{dec}}\right.$ $\left.\sim t_{\mathrm{arm}}\right)$, and the increase of $\sigma$ with density is shallower. Turbulence decays even more efficiently in the dense gaseous clumps, where $\sigma$ reaches a few tens of kilometers per second. Their typical lifetime ( $>100 \mathrm{Myr})$ is considerably longer than the turbulence decay timescale (few Myr from Equation (5)). As a result, $\sigma$ reaches an equilibrium value, which weakly depends on density (purple lines in Figure 2).

Star formation in our model proceeds in the cold dense gas. The pressure support in this gas is dominated by small-scale turbulent motions, as the sound speed in this phase is $c_{\mathrm{s}} \sim 1 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \sqrt{T / 100 \mathrm{~K}}$ and the turbulent velocities $(\sigma>$ $3 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ) are supersonic. Therefore, the gas in this regime forms stars with an efficiency that depends on $\sigma$ (Equations (3) and (4)). In our simulation we find that the average $\sigma$ in cold gas depends on density as (dashed red line in Figure 2(a))

$$\sigma=12 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\left(\frac{n}{100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}\right)^{1 / 2} \text {. }$$

This scaling with density is consistent with compression in a "non-radiative" (with respect to turbulent energy) shock. In this case the turbulent "temperature" after the shock goes as the Mach number squared: $\sigma^{2} \propto M^{2}$. As noted before, the associated orders of magnitude density jumps indicate that the shocks preceding spiral arms are almost isothermal (with respect to thermal energy). In this case the density jump also goes as the Mach number squared: $\rho \propto M^{2}$ (e.g., Zel'dovich \& Raizer 1967). These scaling relations for $\sigma$ and $\rho$ then imply $\sigma$ $\propto \rho^{1 / 2}$.

The obtained scaling is opposite to what follows from the empirical Larson relations, $\sigma \propto \rho^{-0.5}$ (Larson 1981), which are also consistent with the turbulent origin (Kritsuk et al. 2013). This difference originates from the mismatch of scales on which we consider turbulence with the observed GMC sizes. Most of the observed GMCs have sizes of $\sim 1-10 \mathrm{pc}$, and therefore they reside in the inertial interval of turbulent cascade driven on the scale of disk height, $\sim 200-300 \mathrm{pc}$. At the resolution of our simulation the inertial range is not yet resolved (see Section 2.1), and thus we cannot expect correct predictions of the Larson relations. The turbulent cascade that is expected to develop on the scales unresolved in our simulations would result in an inverted relation between $\sigma$ and $\rho$ consistent with the Larson relations (Kritsuk et al. 2013).

Figure 2(a) shows significant scatter around the average behavior expressed by Equation (7) ( $\sim 0.3$ dex). We find that this scatter is mostly due to the variation of the local compression rate $\left(-\nabla_{i} u_{i}\right)$. This offers hope that $\sigma$ may be approximated in simulations without explicit SGS turbulence modeling using dependencies of $\sigma$ on density and $\nabla_{i} u_{i}$, that can be calibrated using simulations with such modeling. We will explore the relation of the local compression rate and the subgrid turbulent velocity in a future study.

In closing, we note that the above discussion shows that the key mechanism of turbulence production in star-forming regions of our disk is the compression of warm, transonic gas by spiral waves. This justifies the usage of the linear closure for the turbulent stress tensor $\tau_{i j}$, as discussed in Section 2.1. In particular, production of SGS turbulence from resolved motions is mostly important in diffuse gas with $T \sim 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}$. This temperature corresponds to the sound speed of $c_{\mathrm{s}} \sim$ $10 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$; therefore, the typical turbulent velocities in this gas (a few kilometers per second) are sub- or transonic, for which the linear closure for the stress tensor is more appropriate (Schmidt \& Federrath 2011).

\subsection{Star Formation Efficiency}

In our simulation we derive the $\mathrm{SFE} \epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in each cell using Equations (3) and (4). These equations parameterize the local SFE via the virial parameter:

$$\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}} \propto\left(\frac{t_{\mathrm{ff}}}{t_{\mathrm{cr}}}\right)^{2} \propto \frac{\sigma^{2}+c_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}(T)}{\rho}$$

where $\rho, T$, and $\sigma$ are the gas density, temperature, and SGS turbulent velocity dispersion self-consistently evolved by the code, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 1(d), the virial parameter of modeled cells on a scale of $40 \mathrm{pc}$ is rather high and exhibits significant variation.

Given the exponential dependence of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ on the virial parameter, the $\alpha_{\text {vir }}$ variation translates into even wider spatial variation of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$. This variation in the dense gas can be seen in panels (e) and (f) of Figure 1, which show maps of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ and the gas depletion time to star formation relative to the gas denser than $n=10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, shown by the thin gray contours.

The depletion time of molecular gas, and thus possibly $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$, is indeed observed to vary along the spiral arms of M51 (Meidt et al. 2013). As an extreme example of this spatial variation, compare the spiral arms denoted as $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ in panel (e) of Figure 1. Panels (a) and (b) of the figure show that the gas in these arms has similar density and temperature, and therefore the universal SFE model would predict the same efficiency and similar depletion time in both arms. However, in our simulation spiral arm A forms stars much more efficiently than arm B due to lower turbulent velocity predicted by the SGS model.

As discussed in Section 3.1, the difference in $\sigma$ originates from the variation in the local compression rates. The compression rate, in its turn, may vary due to several reasons. First, gas may experience different compression in spiral arms depending on the large-scale dynamics and development of local disk instabilities. Second, turbulence may be suppressed (enhanced) in spiral arms due to local expansion (contraction) of gas along the arm. Third, spiral arms may be affected by hot gas from either $\mathrm{SN}$ bubbles or the halo gas penetrating into the
