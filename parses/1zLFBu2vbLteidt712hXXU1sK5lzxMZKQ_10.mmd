FIg. 15.-Time-average density power spectrum compensated by $k$. The straight lines represent the least-squares fits to the data for $\log k / k_{\min } \in[0.6,1.3]$ and $\log k / k_{\min } \in[1.4,1.7]$. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.] power spectrum, $-0.90 \pm 0.02$, is substantially shallower than -1.07 at $1024^{3}$. Thus, spectral index estimates based on lowresolution simulations bear large uncertainties due to the bottleneck contamination. We also note that the time-averaging over many snapshots is essential to get the correct slope for the density power spectrum, since the density exhibits strong variations on very short (compared to $t_{d}$ ) timescales. The spectrum tends to get shallower aftercollisions of strong shocks, when the PDF's highdensity wing rises above its average lognormal representation.

There are good reasons to believe that in weakly compressible isothermal flows the three-dimensional density power spectrum scales in the inertial subrange as $\sim k^{-7 / 3}$ (Bayly et al. 1992). Our $512^{3}$ transonic simulation at $\mathcal{M}=1$ with purely solenoidal driving (not shown) returned a time-average power index of $-1.6 \pm 0.1$, which is probably still too shallow due to the unresolved inertial range (see also $\S 3.3$ ). An index of -1.7 at $\mathcal{M}=1.2$ was obtained by Kim \& Ryu (2005) at the same resolution (but with a more diffusive solver). Our simulations at higher resolution for $\mathcal{M}=6$ give a slope of approximately -1.1 . At even higher Mach numbers, the spectra tend to flatten further. From the continuity arguments, there should exist a Mach number value $\mathcal{M}_{41}$ such that the power index of the density spectrum is
