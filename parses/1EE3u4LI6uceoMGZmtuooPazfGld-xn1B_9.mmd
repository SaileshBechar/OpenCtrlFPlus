disk. In particular, as can be seen in Figure 1(b), spiral arm B is adjacent to a bubble of hot gas in the downstream direction. The thermal pressure of this hot gas may contribute to compression.

In all three scenarios higher turbulent velocities result from stronger compression. More quantitative information about the SFE variation with density can be drawn from the phase diagram shown in Figure 2(b). The most noticeable features of this diagram are the sharp cutoff at $n \sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ and the ordersof-magnitude variation of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$.

The exponential cutoff at $n \sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ in our model arises naturally from the thermal support in warm diffuse gas. In particular, turbulent velocities in this phase are mostly subsonic, and gas is supported against gravity mainly by its thermal pressure. This thermal support is codified in the definition of the crossing time given by Equation (4), which results in the exponential suppression of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in the diffuse gas, as the sound-crossing time becomes considerably shorter than the free-fall time: $t_{\mathrm{ff}} / t_{\mathrm{cr}} \sim 26 \sqrt{T_{4} / n_{0}}$, where $T_{4}=T / 10^{4} \mathrm{~K}$ and $n_{0}=n / 1 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.

In the cold phase, on the other hand, the turbulence is supersonic and its pressure provides the main support against gravity. The typical turbulent crossing time in this regime is of the order of the free-fall time: $t_{\mathrm{ff}} / t_{\mathrm{cr}} \sim 2.6 \sigma_{1} / \sqrt{n_{2}}$, where $\sigma_{1}=\sigma / 10 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $n_{2}=n / 100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. This ratio corresponds to $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 1 \%$, typical for star-forming regions. As a result, in the turbulent model only cold dense gas forms stars at a reasonably large efficiency. The transition from the negligible values of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in the warm diffuse gas to $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 1 \%$ in the cold dense gas is sharp due to the abrupt drop in temperature. This sharp transition is responsible for the effective density threshold for efficient star formation at $n \sim$ $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.

The most efficient star formation in our simulation occurs in gas of density $n \sim 10-100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ in spiral arms and dense clumps. The average trend of $\sigma$ with density $\left(\sigma \propto n^{1 / 2}\right.$ from Equation (7)) substituted into Equation (3) results in constant $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 0.6 \%$ independent of density, as $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}} \propto \sigma^{2} / n$. Therefore, the entire variation of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ around the average value originates from the scatter of modeled turbulent velocities around the average trend. As we mentioned before, this scatter is related to the variation of the local compression rate.

Although the mass-weighted average $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in our disk is quite similar to the universal value $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 1 \%$ at $n>10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ usually inferred from observations, the large spatial and temporal variation of the SFE predicted by our model may have important effects on galaxy evolution. For example, localization of efficient star formation in high-density regions may have a drastic effect on the ability of a galaxy to drive largescale winds and affect the final morphology of the galaxy (e.g., Governato et al. 2010).

\subsection{Comparison with Observed GMCs}

In order to check the viability of our star formation model, we compare its predictions to the SFRs in observed GMCs. Specifically, in Figure 3 we compare the local gas surface density $\left(\Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}=\rho \Delta\right)$ and the surface density of the SFR $\left(\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}=\dot{\rho}_{\star} \Delta=\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \rho \Delta / t_{\mathrm{ff}}\right)$ in individual cells $(\Delta=40 \mathrm{pc})$ to the corresponding quantities measured in GMCs. For a fair comparison, we select the observed clouds with sizes in the range of $\sim 5-100 \mathrm{pc}$ that straddle the cell size in our simulation.

Figure 3. SFRs obtained in our simulation are broadly consistent with observational data. Blue color indicates mass-weighted distribution of cells in the $\Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}-\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$ plane. Black contours indicate $5 \%, 15 \%$, and $30 \%$ of the current total gaseous disk mass. Gray dotted lines correspond to constant values of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ in the simulated star-forming regions. The overplotted data points show different samples of GMCs in the Milky Way: Heiderman et al. (2010; stars and squares), Lada et al. (2010; circles) and Murray (2011; triangles). In this plot we show only GMCs with sizes in the range of $\sim 5-100$ pc that roughly correspond to our cell size, $\Delta=40 \mathrm{pc}$. Two polygons show resolved SFRs in nearby galaxies. The blue one summarizes results of Rebolledo et al. (2015) for three nearby spirals, NGC 6946, NGC 628, and M101, while the pink one indicates star formation in the Small Magellanic Cloud (Bolatto et al. 2011). In the Rebolledo et al. (2015) sample we correct gas surface densities for helium assuming $25 \%$ mass fraction.

Distribution of the SFR in our disk has a sharp upper boundary with a wide tail toward lower rates. The observed local star-forming regions from Heiderman et al. (2010), Lada et al. (2010), and Murray (2011) agree remarkably well with the upper envelope of our predicted distribution, whereas the extragalactic data agree with the main mode of SF in our simulation. This may be because studies of the local GMCs focus on the regions with the most efficient star formation. Blind surveys of star formation in the Milky Way GMCs, on the other hand, start revealing abundant gas with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \ll 1 \%$ (N. Murray 2016, private communication).

In contrast to the local surveys, GMCs in other galaxies are sampled more uniformly and do indicate prevalent dense gas with low SFE. For instance, the blue polygon in Figure 3 summarizes the Rebolledo et al. (2015) results for three nearby spiral galaxies: NGC 6946, NGC 628, and M101. Their inferred SFRs do agree with the typical SFRs of the dense gas in our simulation. The observed SFR distribution in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; pink polygon in Figure 3; Bolatto et al. 2011) also reveals that most of its dense molecular gas forms stars rather inefficiently. However, the SMC is a dwarf galaxy with substantially different dynamics and significantly lower metallicity than the Milky Way; therefore, its global SFR is considerably lower than that of our simulated galaxy. This discrepancy is yet another manifestation of the SFE variation and its dependence on galaxy properties.
