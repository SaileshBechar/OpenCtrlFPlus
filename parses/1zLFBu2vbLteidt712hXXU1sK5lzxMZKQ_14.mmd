the inertial range power index, $\beta=1.69 \pm 0.02$, is very close to the Kolmogorov value of $5 / 3$.

To further check our conjecture expressed by equation (38), we measured the first three scaling exponents for the modified structure functions $\mathcal{S}_{p}$ using a subsample of 34 snapshots evenly distributed in time through $t \in[5,10] t_{d}$ using a sample of $2 \times 10^{9}$ point pairs per PDF per snapshot. The resulting third-order exponents are very close to unity as expected, $\zeta_{3}^{\perp}=1.01 \pm 0.02$ and $\zeta_{3}^{\|}=0.95 \pm 0.02$. This strongly suggests that a relationship similar to Kolmogorov's " $4 / 5$  law may hold for compressible flows as well.

Both the first-order exponents $\zeta_{1}^{\perp}=0.467 \pm 0.004$ and $\zeta_{1}^{\|}=$ $0.451 \pm 0.004$ and the second-order exponents $\zeta_{2}^{\perp}=0.80 \pm$ 0.01 and $\zeta_{2}^{\|}=0.76 \pm 0.01$ slightly deviate from the $\mathrm{K} 41 \mathrm{p} / 3$ scaling as would be the case in intermittent turbulence. The corresponding relative (to the third order) exponents $Z_{1}^{\perp}=0.46$ and $Z_{1}^{\|}=0.47$ and $Z_{2}^{\perp}=0.79$ and $Z_{2}^{\|}=0.80$ are also somewhat higher than their counterparts for the velocity structure functions discussed in $\S 3.4$, indicating certain structural differences between the $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ fields.

Note, as the Mach number changes from $\mathcal{M}<1$ to $\mathcal{M}=6$, the slope of the density power spectrum gets shallower from $-7 / 3$ to -1.1 , but the slope of the velocity power spectrum gets steeper from $-5 / 3$ to -1.9 . At the same time, the power spectrum of the mixed variable $\boldsymbol{v}$ remains approximately invariant, as predicted by the model.

Our numerical experiments thus confirm one of the basic assumptions adopted in the compressible cascade model, namely, that equation (32) for the energy transfer rate holds true. The first assumption concerning the properties of the self-similar hierarchical density structure, equation (31) put forward by von Weizsacker (1951), seems to be also satisfied in the simulations quite well, at least to the first order.

\section{DISCUSSION}

The major deficiency of the numerical experiments discussed above is still their limited spatial resolution that bounds the integral scale Reynolds numbers to values much smaller than those estimated for the real molecular clouds. This hurdle apparently cannot be overcome in the near future, but still the progress achieved in the past 15 years in this direction is very impressive.

The second important deficiency of our model is the lack of magnetic effects which are known to be essential for star formation applications. This subject still remains a topic for the future work awaiting the development of a high-quality MHD solver suitable to modeling of supersonic flows at moderately high Reynolds numbers with computational resources available today.

Another set of potential issues relates to the external driving force that is supposed to simulate the energy input by HD instabilities in real molecular clouds. The large-scale driving force we used in these simulations is not perfectly isotropic due to the uneven distribution of power between the solenoidal and dilatational modes (perhaps, a typical situation for the interstellar conditions). We also use a static driving force that could potentially cause some anomalies on timescales of many dynamical times. However, while strong anisotropies can significantly affect the scaling of high-order moments (Porter et al. 2002; Mininni et al. 2006), the departures from Kolmogorov-like scaling we observe in the lower order statistics appear to be too strong to be explained solely as a result of the specific properties of the driving. The sensitivity of our result to turbulence forcing remains to be verified with future high-resolution simulations involving a variety of driving options. The options for observational validation of our numerical models are limited. Interstellar turbulence in general and supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds in particular could hardly be uniform and/or isotropic (Kaplan \& Pikelner 1970). There are multiple driving mechanisms of different natures operating on different scales in the ISM (Norman \& Ferrara 1996; Mac Low \& Klessen 2004), so the source function of turbulence is expected to be broadband. Various observational techniques employed to extract information about the scaling properties of turbulence have their own limitations, including a finite instrumental resolution, insufficiently large data sets, inability to fully access the three-dimensional information without additional a priori assumptions, etc. Moreover, complexity of the effective equation of state of the ISM and many other physical processes so far ignored in the simplified numerical models should also make the comparison of observations and simulations uncertain. Nevertheless, it makes sense to compare our results with the scaling properties of supersonic turbulence obtained from observations.

Applying the velocity channel analysis (VCA) technique (Lazarian \& Pogosyan 2000, 2006) to power spectra of integrated intensity maps and single-velocity channel maps of the Perseus region, Padoan et al. (2006) found a velocity power spectrum index $\beta=1.8$ that is reasonably close to our measurement $\beta=$ 1.95. The structure function exponents measured for the M1-67 nebula by Grosdidier et al. (2001), $\zeta_{1} \approx 0.5$ and $\zeta_{2} \approx 0.9$, match quite nicely with our results discussed in $\S 3.4, \zeta_{1}=0.54$ and $\zeta_{2}=0.97$

Using maps of the ${ }^{13} \mathrm{CO} J=1-0$ emission line of the molecular cloud complexes in Perseus, Taurus, and Rosetta, Padoan et al. (2004a) computed the power spectra of the column density estimated using the LTE method (Dickman 1978). The slopes of the measured spectra corrected for temperature and saturation effects on the ${ }^{13} \mathrm{CO} J=1-0$ line, $-0.74 \pm 0.07,-0.74 \pm 0.08$, and $-0.76 \pm 0.08$, respectively, are notably shallower than our estimate for the density spectrum power index $-1.07 \pm 0.01$ (see $\S$ 3.6). The apparent $4 \sigma$ discrepancy is most probably due to an insufficiently high Mach number adopted in our simulations. Alternatively, it can be attributed to anisotropies in the molecular cloud turbulence, intermittent large-scale driving force acting on the clouds, or limitations of the LTE method.

As far as the fractal dimension is concerned, the observational measurements for molecular clouds and star-forming regions tend to cluster around $D=2.3 \pm 0.3$ (Elmegreen \& Falgarone 1996, 2001). Stochastically variable turbulent (WC) winds from "dustars" feeding the ISM also demonstrate similar fractal dimension $D=2.2-2.3$, and the same morphology of clumps forming and dissipating in real time is clearly seen in the outer parts of the wind where the picture is not smeared by projection effects (Grosdidier et al. 2001).

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Using large-scale numerical simulations of nonmagnetic highly compressible driven turbulence at an rms Mach number of 6, we were able to resolve the inertial range scaling and have demonstrated that:

1. The probability density function of the gas density is perfectly represented by a lognormal distribution over many decades in probability as predicted from simple theoretical considerations.

2. Low-order velocity statistics deviate substantially from Kolmogorov laws for incompressible turbulence. Both velocity power spectra and velocity structure functions show steeper than Kolmogorov slopes, with the scaling exponents of the third-order velocity structure functions far in excess of unity.
