magnetized turbulence will allow us to compare our HD results with those from super-AlfvAnic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations where equivalent pure HD simulations are not available in the literature.

Numerical simulations of decaying supersonic HD turbulence with the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) in two dimensions were pioneered by Passot et al. (1988) ${ }^{3}$ and then followed up with high-resolution two- and three-dimensional simulations by Porter et al. (1992a, 1992b, 1994, 1998). Sytine et al. (2000) compared the results of PPM Euler computations with PPM Navier-Stokes results and showed that the Euler simulations agree well with the high-Re limit attained in the Navier-Stokes models. The convergence in a statistical sense as well as the direct comparison of structures in configuration space indicate the ability of PPM to accurately simulate turbulent flows over a wide range of scales. More recently, Porter et al. (2002) discussed measures of intermittency in simulated driven transonic flows at Mach numbers of the order unity on grids of up to $512^{3}$ points. Porter et al. (1999) review the results of these numerical studies, focusing on the origin and evolution of turbulent structures in physical space as well as on scaling laws for two-point structure functions. One of the important results of this fundamental work is the demonstration of the compatibility of a Kolmogorov-type (Kolmogorov 1941 a, hereafter K41) spectrum with a mild gas compressibility at transonic Mach numbers.

Since most of the computations discussed above assume a perfect gas equation of state with the ratios of specific heat $\gamma=$ $7 / 5$ or $5 / 3$ and Mach numbers generally below 2 , the question remains whether this result will still hold for near isothermal conditions and hypersonic Mach numbers characteristic of dense parts of star-forming molecular clouds where the gas compressibility is much higher. What kind of coherent structures should one expect to see in highly supersonic turbulence? Do low-order statistics of turbulence follow the K41 predictions closely in this regime? How can the statistical diagnostics traditionally used in studies of incompressible turbulence be extended to reconstruct the energy cascade properties in supersonic flows? How can we measure the intrinsic intermittency of supersonic turbulence? Many of these and similar questions can only be addressed with numerical simulations of sufficiently high resolution. The interpretation of astronomical data from new surveys of the cold ISM and dust in the Milky Way by the Spitzer and Herschel Space Observatory satellites requires more detailed knowledge of these basic properties of supersonic turbulence.

In this paper we report the results from large-scale numerical simulations of driven supersonic isothermal turbulence at Mach 6 with PPM and grid resolutions up to $2048^{3}$ points. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the details of the simulations' setup and describes the input parameters. The statistical diagnostics, including power spectra of the velocity, the kinetic energy, and the density, and velocity structure functions, together with a discussion of turbulent structures and their fractal dimension are presented in $\S 3$. In $\S 3.9$ we combine the scaling laws determined in our numerical experiments to verify a simple compressible cascade model proposed by Fleck (1996). We also introduce a new variable $\boldsymbol{v} \equiv \rho^{1 / 3} \boldsymbol{u}$ that controls the energy transfer rate through the compressible cascade. We then summarize the results and discuss possible ways to validate our numerical model with astrophysical observations in $\S \S 4$ and 5 .

\section{METHODOLOGY}

We use PPM implemented in the Enzo code $^{4}$ to solve the Euler equations for the gas density $\rho$ and the velocity $\boldsymbol{u}$ with a constant external acceleration term $\boldsymbol{F}$,

$$\begin{gathered}
\partial_{t} \rho+\nabla \cdot(\rho \boldsymbol{u})=0, \\
\partial_{t} \boldsymbol{u}+\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \boldsymbol{u}=-\nabla \rho / \rho+\boldsymbol{F},
\end{gathered}$$

in a periodic box of linear size $L=1$ starting with an initially uniform density distribution $\rho(\boldsymbol{x}, t=0)=\rho_{0}(\boldsymbol{x}) \equiv 1$ and assuming the sound speed $c \equiv 1$. The equations that were actually numerically integrated were written in a conventional form of conservation laws for the mass, momentum, and total energy that is less compact, but nearly equivalent to equations (1) and (2), since in practice we mimic the isothermal equation of state by setting the specific heat ratio in the ideal gas equation of state very close to unity, $\gamma=1.001$.

The simulations were initialized on grids of $256^{3}$ or $512^{3}$ points with a random velocity field $\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}, t=0)=\boldsymbol{u}_{0}(\boldsymbol{x}) \propto \boldsymbol{F}$ that contains only large-scale power within the range of wavenumbers $k / k_{\min } \in[1,2]$, where $k_{\min }=2 \pi$, and that corresponds to the rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}=6$. The dynamical time is hereafter defined as $t_{d} \equiv L /(2 \mathcal{M})$.

\subsection{Uniform Grid Simulation at $1024^{3}$}

Our major production run is performed on a grid of $1024^{3}$ points that allowed us to resolve a portion of the uncontaminated inertial range sufficient to get a first approximation for the loworder scaling exponents. We started the simulation at a lower resolution of $512^{3}$ points and evolved the flow from the initial conditions for five dynamical times to stir up the gas in the box. Then we doubled the resolution and evolved the simulation for another $5 t_{d}$ on a grid of $1024^{3}$ points.

The time-average statistics were computed using 170 snapshots evenly spaced in time over the final segment of $4 t_{d}$. (We allowed one dynamical time for flow relaxation at high resolution, so that it could reach a statistical steady state after regridding.) We used the full set of 170 snapshots to derive the density statistics, since the density field displays a very high degree of intermittency. This gave us a very large statistical sample, e.g., $2 \times 10^{11}$ measurements were available to determine the probability density function (PDF) of the gas density discussed in $\S 3.2$. The time-average power spectra discussed in $\S \S 3.3,3.5,3.6$, and 3.9 are also based on the full data set. The velocity structure functions presented in $\S 3.4$ are derived from a sample of $20 \%$ of the snapshots covering the same period of $4 t_{d}$. The corresponding two-point PDFs of velocity differences were built on $(2-4) \times 10^{9}$ pairs per snapshot each, depending on the pair separation.

\subsection{AMR Simulations}

The adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations with effective resolution of $2048^{3}$ points were also initialized by evolving the flow on the root grid of $512^{3}$ points for six dynamical times. Then one level of refinement by a factor of 4 was added in both cases that covers on average $50 \%$ of the domain volume. The grid is refined to better resolve strong shocks and to capture HD instabilities in the layers of strong shear. We use the native shock-detection algorithm of PPM, and we flag for refinement those zones that are associated with shocks with density jumps in
