does slightly shift with resolution. Such dependence indicates that the feedback in our simulation is not efficient enough to self-regulate the star formation and erase dependence of its large-scale properties on the assumptions about local SFE that do depend on resolution. This behavior agrees with findings of Agertz \& Kravtsov (2015), who showed that high local SFE is required to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies via feedback self-regulation. As they also showed, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 1 \%$, which is the average SFE in our disk, is not enough to make the feedback efficient. However, the actual values of SFE in our simulation may be somewhat low due to overestimation of $\sigma$ in star-forming regions resulting from the poorly resolved onset of turbulent cascade. We will present a detailed discussion of the resolution tests and performance of our model depending on feedback recipes in a follow-up paper.

\section{DISCUSSION}

The results presented in the previous section show that our turbulent model for star formation predicts the wide variation of SFE from $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}<0.1 \%$ to $\sim 10 \%$. The predicted distribution of SFE agrees with SFRs observed on a wide range of scales: from the scale of individual star-forming regions $(\sim 40 \mathrm{pc})$ to kiloparsec scales and the scales of entire galaxies. This agreement is nontrivial because on kiloparsec scales our model predictions are determined by the small-scale spatial distribution of density and turbulent energy shaped by galactic evolution. Moreover, on the scale of individual star-forming regions (cells in simulations) the SFR is not tuned but is estimated from the local gas density and turbulent energy using predictions of GMC-scale simulations (see Section 2.2). Once calibrated to reproduce the results of such simulations, parameters of both the SGS turbulence model and the prescription for star formation remain fixed in our galactic disk simulations. Remarkably, the model predicts SFRs in agreement with observations without any additional tweaking of these parameters.

Although the agreement with the observed KS relation can also be achieved in simulations that adopt universal $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ recipes, such recipes require ad hoc assumptions about a value of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ and criteria for star formation.

The obtained variation of SFE may have important implications for understanding self-regulation of star formation during galaxy evolution. A number of studies showed that in order to reproduce cosmic star formation histories and resulting morphology of Milky-Way-sized galaxies, simulations require high local SFE (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2014; Agertz \& Kravtsov 2015, and references therein). The low global SFE in such simulations is then achieved as a result of the star formation self-regulation by effective feedback. The star formation model in our disk simulation, on the other hand, explicitly predicts that in galaxies with average $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 1 \%$ certain regions may form stars very efficiently (with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \sim 10 \%$ ), regardless of the global SFR.

The predicted localized efficient star formation also has implications for outflow driving. The concentration of massive stars in regions of high $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ means that SNe can explode there in a correlated manner, which can facilitate launching of fountain flows or even galactic winds (e.g., Governato et al. 2010). We have checked that a resimulation of our disk with the same feedback model but $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ fixed at the value of $1 \%$ results in no gas outflows, in contrast to our fiducial simulation, which sustains prominent fountain outflows. We will present a detailed comparison of these simulations in a subsequent paper.

The second important feature of our model is the pronounced physical density threshold for star formation at $n_{\text {th }} \sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Such a density threshold is often set by hand in galaxy formation modeling. In our simulation, however, this threshold arises from the rapid drop in temperature as density increases beyond $n_{\text {th }}$. Such a threshold is quite similar to the effective thresholds in $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-based models of star formation in which local SFE is modulated by the molecular gas mass fraction $f_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ : $\dot{\rho}_{\star}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} f_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \rho / t_{\mathrm{ff}}$ (Robertson \& Kravtsov 2008; Gnedin et al. 2009). In particular, the molecular fraction correlates with the cold gas abundance, and therefore the threshold in our model corresponds to the density at which $f_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ rapidly increases. We thus also expect that $n_{\text {th }}$ in our model should depend on gas metallicity similarly to the threshold in the $f_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$-based models if gas thermodynamics is modeled properly to capture dependence of the net cooling function on gas metallicity.

Modeling of the star formation density threshold can be potentially improved if we take into account effects of gas clumpiness on its net cooling rate: $\Lambda_{\text {cool }} \propto C$, where $C \equiv\left\langle\rho^{2}\right\rangle /\langle\rho\rangle^{2} \geqslant 1$ is a clumping factor and brackets denote averaging over a certain spatial region. Galaxy formation simulations almost always assume $C=1$ on the unresolved scales, but actual dense ISM can be quite clumpy in regions where turbulence is supersonic. The local clumping factor can be derived from the shape of the underlying subgrid density PDF, which can be estimated, for instance, with the aid of the SGS turbulence model from the local parameters, such as effective Mach number. The clumping factor could then be accounted for in the calculation of the net cooling rate $\Lambda_{\text {cool }}$. Overall, the star formation threshold should shift to lower values of density for $C>1$.

The importance of turbulence for modeling star formation in galaxy formation simulations has been already recognized. Specifically, Hopkins et al. (2013) developed a model for the star formation threshold, in which star formation is allowed only in self-gravitating gas, $\alpha_{\text {vir }}<1$, but with a constant efficiency of $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=100 \%$. Even though their model also predicts significant localization of star formation, it substantially differs from our model both technically and conceptually.

From the technical point of view, our SGS model provides a more appropriate way to track local $\sigma$ than an estimate based on the local velocity gradients on the scale of resolution. Due to substantial effects of numerical viscosity on these scales, such an estimate is not accurate.

More importantly, in our model we vary $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ continuously with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$, as predicted by the Padoan et al. (2012) model, while the prescription of Hopkins et al. (2013) adopts a fixed $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=100 \%$ for $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<1$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}=0$ otherwise. For comparison, the Padoan et al. (2012) model predicts $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \approx 26 \%$ for $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}} \approx 1$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ reaches $>99 \%$ only at $\alpha_{\text {vir }} \lesssim 0.1$. Moreover, in our model star formation can proceed in gravitationally unbound regions. In the turbulence-driven star formation, a given region may be globally unbound but can contain local bound starforming regions created by the turbulent cascade on small scales. For example, at $\alpha_{\text {vir }} \approx 10$ the Padoan et al. (2012) model predicts $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}} \approx 1 \%$, which is a healthy efficiency estimated for many GMCs (e.g., Krumholz et al. 2012a). Thus, the sharp threshold in $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ for $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ is not warranted.

Turbulent models of star formation with $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ continuously varying with $\alpha_{\text {vir }}$ were studied by other authors as well. In
